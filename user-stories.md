As a user I want to beable to see three possible products and pic my favorite one. Then I want three more to show up so I can repeat. A market research wants to be able to see the data in clear charted format. As a developer I want to have a constructor create all the products and then have a RNG pick 3 at a time with no dupe's. I want to record all the data in arrays and store in local storage and display using a chart.
